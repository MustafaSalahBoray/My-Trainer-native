                <h2>What is Whey Protein?</h2>
                <p class="text-danger fs-5">
                    Milk contains two kinds of protein predominantly – casein and
                    whey. A mixture of proteins becomes isolated from whey during
                    cheese production from milk. This protein mixture is known as whey
                    protein. Basically, the fatty substance in milk coagulates
                    together during cheese production, and separates the whey, usually
                    contained in the liquid portion of milk, as a by-product. For the
                    longest time, cheesemakers would discard this whey, but not
                    anymore. Now, whey protein is recognized for its nutritional
                    value.

                <h2>Nutrition Facts of Whey Protein</h2>
                <p class="text-danger fs-5">
                    One scoop (approx 32 g) of the average whey protein powder
                    contains 113 calories, of which 4.5% is borrowed from the fat
                    content.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Total fat content is 0.5 g, of which saturated fat is 0.3 g.
                        Trans Fat is 0 g.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Polyunsaturated Fat and Monounsaturated Fat are 0.1 g each.

                    <li>
                        Cholesterol is 5.1 mg, which would make up for 2% of your daily
                        requirement.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sodium contained is 50 mg, which too, makes up for 2% of your
                        daily nutritional value.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Potassium content is 160 mg, so you can expect 5% of your daily
                        potassium requirement to be met from a scoop of whey protein.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The total carb content is 2 g, out of which, dietary fibre makes

                    <li>
                        The protein content is 25 g. You will find 2% Iron and 12%
                        Calcium in the measured amount of whey protein powder.

                    Whey protein then undergoes another process to make one of three
                    main types:

                        whey protein concentrate vary widely in their protein, lactose
                        and fat content. Whey protein concentrate is in many protein
                        drinks, bars and nutritional products. It’s also used in infant
                        formula.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        <span class="fw-bold"> Isolate:</span> This type is
                        consistently high in protein and low in fat or lactose. You may
                        see it listed on the labels of protein supplements, such as bars
                        and drinks. Whey protein isolate may be a suitable choice for
                        people who are lactose intolerant — but don’t try any of these
                        if you have a milk allergy.

                        hydrolyzed whey protein, whey hydrolysate is the easiest to
                        digest. It’s gentle on digestion because its long protein
                        chains, called peptides, are pre-broken down into shorter ones.
                        Specialized infant formulas often use hydrolyzed whey protein.
                        You may also see it in medical supplements for nutritional
                        deficiencies.

                    <li>
                        <span class="fw-bold"> Muscle building:</span> Muscles love
                        protein, especially complete proteins like whey. “Whey protein
                        contains branched-chain amino acids, a specific type of amino
                        acid that helps with muscle building,” Smith says.
                    </li>

                    <li>

                        in whey protein help repair skin and tissues from wounds or
                        surgery.

                            Weight gain and nutritional boost:
                        </span>
                        People who need to gain weight can benefit from whey protein.
                        It’s also helpful if a person has a long-term illness and needs
                        extra nutrition. “If you can’t get enough protein from whole
                        food sources, a whey protein supplement can help,” says Smith.
                        “It’s beneficial for people who have chewing or swallowing
                        disorders or a lack of appetite.”

                <h2>Side effects and risks of whey protein</h2>
                <p class="text-danger fs-5">
                    Whey protein is generally safe for most people to take, as long as
                    they don’t have a dairy allergy. But there are some drawbacks:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="fw-bold"> Calorie content:</span> Whey protein
                        may be low fat and low carb, but it still has calories. “Too
                        many calories from anything, including protein, leads to weight
                        gain,” Smith explains.

                    <br />

                            Extra sugar or processed ingredients:
                        </span>
                        Many protein powders and shakes contain processed ingredients
                        like artificial flavors, sweeteners or added sugar. “It’s better
                        to get your protein from whole foods and a varied diet, rather
                        than a supplement, bar or shake,” says Smith. “If you use a
                        supplement, look for one that lists whey protein as the only
                        ingredient.”

                    <li>
                        <span class="fw-bold">Possible contaminants:</span>
                        Protein supplements don’t have strict regulations like foods and
                        drugs. “The purity might not be proven in some protein
                        supplements,” says Smith. “They can have fillers or heavy metal
                        contaminants that aren’t listed on the label.” Choose whey
                        protein products that are NSF Certified for Sport or certified
                        by Informed Choice. These products have been independently
                        tested for purity.

                    <li>
                        <span class="fw-bold">Possible digestive problems:</span>
                        Some people experience constipation, diarrhea or nausea from
                        taking whey protein, especially if they take large amounts.

                <h2>Don’t go overboard with protein</h2>
                <p class="text-danger fs-5">
                    Whey protein has its place if you’re an athlete building muscle or
                    trying to fill some nutritional gaps. But most people already get
                    enough protein and don’t need supplements.
                </p>
                <br />
                “Your body can only use 20 to 40 grams of protein at a time,” Smith
                says. “Even if you’re trying to bulk up, taking amounts higher than
                this isn’t helpful. Most people don’t need whey protein to meet
                their protein requirements if they’re eating a healthy diet.”
                <br />
                <br />
                As with any supplement, it’s best to discuss with your physician
                before you start taking protein supplements. They can interfere with
                some medications or may actually be harmful for people with certain
                conditions.
